# Tohoku-Earthquakes
This is a Shiny app that visualizes earthquakes near the epicenter of the Great Tohoku Earthquake in Japan.

The Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan was built to withstand earthquakes up to a magnitude 8.6.  An earthquake of such magnitude had not been recorded in the area; nor was it ever expected to.  However, on March 11, 2011 a magnitude 9.1 hit off the east coast of Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster and around 19,500 total deaths.  The earthquake is one of five of the world's largest recorded since modern record keeping.

This app is not suggestive of how decision makers concluded the frequency of catastrophic earthquakes in real time.  Rather, it offers a real-world example of how one *could* justify their predictions of such.  Earthquakes, especially those of considerable magnitude, occur infrequently and thus data for predicting them is sparse.
Using historical data from the USGS' Earthquake Catalog (ComCat), the average annual frequencies of earthquakes in the area of relative magnitude are plotted,
dating back as far as 1965 up to the most recent earthquake *before* the Great Earthquake that devastated the nation.  The app allows the user to make predictions based
on varying levels of model capacity, ultimately showing how a model that is overfit does not make useful predictions.
