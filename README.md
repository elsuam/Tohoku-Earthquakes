# Tohoku-Earthquakes
This is a Shiny app that visualizes earthquakes near the epicenter of the Great Tohoku Earthquake in Japan.

(brief history)

Using historical data from the USGS' Earthquake Catalog (ComCat), the average annual frequencies of earthquakes of relative magnitude are plotted,
dating back as far as 1965 up to the most recent earthquake *before* the Great Quake that devastated the nation.  The app allows the user to make predictions based
on varying elvels of model capacity, ultimately showing how a model that is overfit does not make useful predictions.
